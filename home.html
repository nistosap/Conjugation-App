    Welcome to Basic Plains Cree Conjugation: Y dialect</b></u></p>
<p><b>Important Notes:</b>
<br><b>1)</b> This app will only work with <b>SRO</b> spelling of Cree verbs.<br>
<b>2)</b> When you add/edit the <b>english</b>, if you use &#147;<b>am</b>&#148; at the beginning of the translation, it will be conjugated properly. If you use &#147;<b>self</b>&#148; it will be properly translated. If you put &#147;<b>s.o.</b>&#148; (abbreviation of &#147;someone&#148;) it will translated properly.<br>
3) All errors are mine.<br>

<p>My name is <a href="mailto:wilfred.bird@sasktel.net">Wilfred Bird (email me)</a> and I created this app to help me with the Cree verb conjugations and hopefully it helps you. The english translations <b>are not</b> conjugated properly and are only to be used as guide.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Verb types in the app</u></b></p>
<p><b>VAI: Animate Intransitive Verb:</b> An animate subject doing an action. Example: I laughed.</p>
<p><b>VTA: Animate Transitive Verb:</b> An animate subject doing an action on/with an animate object. Example: I am playing with my dog.
<br> There are 4 types of VTA verbs. <br>VTA-2: verbs ending &#147;<b>aw</b>&#148;. <br>VTA-3: verbs ending in a <b>consonant</b> and the letter &#147;<b>w</b>&#148;. <br>VTA-4: verbs ending in the letter &#147;<b>t</b>&#148;. <br>VTA-1: all other verbs.  </p>
<p><b>VTI: Inanimate Transitive Verb:</b>An animate subject acting on/with an inanimate object. Example: The dog ate my book.
<br> There are 3 types of VTI verbs. <br>VTI-1: verbs ending in the letter &#147;<b>a</b>&#148;. <br>VTI-2: verbs ending in the letter &#147;<b>&#226;</b>&#148;. <br>VTI-3: all other verbs</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Person</u></b></p>
<p>
<b>1:</b> 1st person &#147;I/Me&#148;<br>
<b>2:</b> 2nd person &#147;You&#148;<br>
<b>3:</b> 3rd person &#147;She/He or Her/Him&#148; but more accurately it would be an animate object, animal, or person as there is no gender for conjugation<br>
<b>3'(P):</b> 3rd person obviative - an animate object/animal/person in relation to a 3rd person - for example: my sister&apos;s <u>friend(s)</u>, Bob&apos;s <u>dog(s)</u>, your parent&apos;s <u>pipe(s)</u> - conjugation for both singular and plural forms are the same so I grouped them together.<br>
<b>1P:</b> 1st person plural &#147;We/Us&#148; exclusive(exc) meaning the speaker and their party, but <b>not</b> the listener, are going to do an action<br>
<b>21:</b> 2nd person inclusive &#147;We/Us&#148; inclusive(inc) meaning the speaker and their party, <b>and</b> the listener, are going to do an action together.<br>
<b>2P:</b> 2nd person plural &#147;You&#148; or &#147;you all&#148;<br>
<b>3P:</b> 3rd person plural &#147;They/Them&#148; or those animate objects, animals, or people.<br>
<b>s.o.:</b> simply &#147;someone&#148; but more accurately it would be an animate object, animal, or person.

<p align="center"><b><u>Grammar definitions</u></b></p>
<p><b>Imperative (Imp)</b> mode is a command. When the speaker is telling someone to do something. Example: Go to sleep<br>
verb pattern: preverb - verb + ending</p>
<p><b>Indicative (Ind)</b> mode is a statement. When a speaker is making a statement. Example: I am eating.
<br>
verb pattern: person + tense - preverb - verb + ending</p>
<p><b>Conjunct (Con)</b> clause is a clause that is not normally a full statement. Example: As I was cleaning, I saw something. &#147;As I was cleaning&#148; is the conjunct clause.<br>
verb pattern: "&#234;-" + tense - preverb - verb + ending</p>
<p><b>Relative</b> clause gives more information about the noun in the sentence. I use &#147;who&#148; in my English samples, but it can translated as &#147;that/which/who/when/where&#148; Examples: I like cats that purr. &#147;That purr&#148; is the relative clause. It was me who took the cookie. &#147;who took&#148; is the relative clause.<br>
verb pattern: "k&#226;-" + tense - preverb - verb + ending</p>
<p><b>Infinitive</b> clause is a verb that seems like the object of the sentence. Example: I like to work. &#147;To work&#148; is the infinitive clause.<br>
verb pattern: "ta-" + tense - preverb - verb + ending</p>
<p><b>Inverse (Inv)</b> mode is used when a speaker is describing a 3rd person (her/him/an animate thing) as the actor of the sentence, acting on/with another person/animate object. Example: She is dancing with me. She is dancing with you. She is dancing with them.<br>
verb pattern: person + tense - preverb - verb + ending
</p>
<p><b>You-Me (You)</b> mode is used when a speaker is describing a 2nd person (you) as the actor of a sentence and the speaker is the object of the sentence. Example. You love me.
<br>
verb pattern: "ki(t)-" + tense - preverb - verb + ending</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Verb tenses:</u></b></p>
<p><b>Present tense:</b> Happening in the present moment.</p>
<p><b>Past tense:</b> It happened before this present moment.</p>
<p><b>Future Indefinite (Fut Ind):</b> It may happen. I am intending to do an action. I am going to do it.</p>
<p><b>Future Definite (Fut Def):</b>  It will happen. I will do it.</p>
<p><b>Future Conditional (Fut Con):</b> If/when I eat, then I will be full. &#147;If/when I eat&#148; is the conditional verb.</p>
